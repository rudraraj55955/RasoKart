## Technical Verification

### TypeScript
- ✅ Zero errors across all packages (`pnpm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Strict mode enabled

### Build
- ✅ API server builds with esbuild (2.7 MB bundle)
- ✅ React frontend builds with Vite

### Database
- ✅ PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ All migrations applied
- ✅ Seed runs idempotently on server start

### Security
- ✅ JWT authentication with 7-day expiry
- ✅ bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- ✅ Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- ✅ Admin role guards on all sensitive routes
- ✅ Merchant scope isolation (can only see own data)
- ✅ No console.log in server code (uses pino structured logging)

### API Endpoints
All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes:
- `401` Unauthorized (missing/invalid JWT)
- `403` Forbidden (insufficient role)  
- `404` Not found
- `400` Bad request (validation errors)
- `500` with structured error body (never exposes stack traces)
